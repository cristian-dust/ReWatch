    <h1>ReWatch Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: <strong>October 25, 2025</strong></p>

    <div class="notice">
      ReWatch is designed to keep your viewing history private. All data described below stays on the device where the extension is installed. No personal information ever leaves your browser.
    </div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains what information the ReWatch Chrome extension ("ReWatch", "the extension", "we") collects, how that information is used, and the choices you have. By installing or using ReWatch you agree to the practices outlined below.
    </p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>ReWatch only stores the minimum information needed to remember your playback position on supported streaming platforms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Media title and, when available, series title, season number, and episode number.</li>
      <li>Playback progress (current time, duration, percentage watched, completion status).</li>
      <li>Platform name and the page URL where progress was captured.</li>
      <li>Timestamp of the last time you watched the title.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>No account identifiers, personal profile data, email addresses, passwords, payment information, or browsing history are collected.</p>

    <h2>Where your data is stored</h2>
    <p>
      All information is saved locally in the Chrome Storage API on the device and browser profile where you installed ReWatch. The data is never transmitted to ReWatch servers or any third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>How your data is used</h2>
    <p>ReWatch uses the stored information exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Show your in-progress titles inside the extension popup.</li>
      <li>Offer to resume playback at the point where you stopped watching.</li>
      <li>Allow you to export or remove saved progress manually.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data sharing</h2>
    <p>
      ReWatch does <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your data. The extension does not communicate with external servers, analytics providers, or advertising networks. Your viewing history remains fully under your control.
    </p>

    <h2>Your choices and controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Delete individual entries:</strong> Use the trash icon next to any item in the ReWatch popup.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear completed titles:</strong> Use the "Clear completed" button to remove items that are 95% complete or higher.</li>
      <li><strong>Remove everything:</strong> Either delete the extension or open <code>chrome://extensions/</code> → ReWatch → "Service worker" → Application tab → Storage to clear all data.</li>
      <li><strong>Export history:</strong> Use the export button in the popup to download a local JSON copy of your watch history.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children&rsquo;s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      ReWatch is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Because no personal data is transmitted or stored off-device, there is no user registration component.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy updates</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements. The "Last updated" date at the top of this page will change when revisions are published. Continued use of ReWatch after a policy update signifies acceptance of the revised terms.
